# Phase Lifecycle And Completion

Execution Plan's Status column is the authority for phase state. Before each transition, root confirms the recorded prior state and the evidence for the next state.
Update that phase row, affected Current State fields, Progress Log, and Next Actions together in the [ledger](progress-template.md). Read back under its Field Rules
before dependent work. Describing a transition in prose does not perform it. On write or readback failure, reconcile durable state before continuing.

## Transitions

| State | Meaning and next transition |
| --- | --- |
| Pending | Dependencies satisfied: enter In Progress before work. |
| In Progress | Execution and ownership release pass: enter Done. |
| Done | Enter In Review before acceptance validation or verifier launch. |
| In Review | Acceptance evidence passes: enter Accepted. Corrections owned by this phase return to In Progress; awaiting corrections in another phase uses Blocked. |
| Accepted | Phase acceptance criteria passed. |
| Blocked | Record cause and prior activity; resume that activity after resolution, never jump directly to Accepted. |
| Not Applicable | Phase removed consistently with current scope after resolving ownership, writes, and obligations; record the reason and checkpoint. |

Read-only discovery may move directly from `In Progress` to `In Review`. An active phase cannot be discarded while ownership, writes, or obligations remain unresolved.
Resolve those first, then record `Not Applicable`. Any retained deliverable changes must meet their applicable acceptance obligations.

Acceptance requires mapped requirements, all recorded phase verification obligations across its assignments, released writers, and current candidate evidence where
applicable. Reopen an accepted phase to In Progress before affecting accepted behavior; use In Review for evidence-only reevaluation of its own guarantees. Cumulative
final review follows [Final Assurance](verification.md#final-assurance). Each phase closes through the procedure below.

## Mandatory Phase Commit

At the end of every phase, commit that phase's accepted deliverable changes, including applicable design updates, and the current run's ledger before dependent work
starts. Include a specification created for the run or explicitly requested source edits where applicable. Compare the specification with its recorded content identity
and user-authorized edits; reconcile unauthorized or unexplained changes before closure. Inspect tracked and untracked files and stage only authorized paths, explicitly
including the ledger if ignored.

Exclude unrelated changes, other runs' records, pre-existing staged content, active writers' files, and other phases' unaccepted deliverable changes, even after ownership
release. Preserve the user's index and worktree. Root serializes ledger updates and checkpoint creation so concurrent phases cannot mutate the snapshot being committed.
If the accepted delta cannot be isolated safely, block closure.

Skip only with `Skipped: no task-owned changes` or `Skipped: no Git repository`, after checking the relevant condition for this checkpoint's scope. Never create an empty
commit. Evaluate changes after preparing required closure records; do not manufacture timestamp-only updates for an already closed phase. Missing Git executable,
identity, permissions, failing hooks, or a commit prohibition is a blocker, not absence of a repository. Do not change Git configuration, disable hooks, or push to satisfy
the gate.

## Close And Compact

After acceptance evidence passes, or the conditions for Not Applicable are met, prepare one closure update containing the phase disposition, released ownership, next actions, 
and one concise phase summary. Consolidate that phase's Progress Log entries in this same update. Preserve unresolved obligations in Active contracts or Blockers And Risks 
before removing superseded entries.

The summary identifies the phase, outcome, candidate, essential evidence, agent dispositions, and carried risks. Reference existing evidence instead of reproducing reports. 
Record the disposition timestamp; Updated reflects the actual edit time. When reopening a phase, retain its previous summary until the next closure consolidates the old and 
new evidence.

Read back the affected records, then commit the accepted deliverable changes and prepared ledger together under Mandatory Phase Commit. Closure requires the verified commit 
or a valid skipped disposition. The ledger need not contain its own commit hash; Git history locates the checkpoint.

Do not release dependencies on a failed or uncertain commit. Preserve the prepared closure state, record the pending persistence step, and inspect the checkpoint before retrying. 
Revalidate deliverable changes made by hooks. After verifying the checkpoint, release dependencies without a separate mandatory compaction edit or commit.

## Complete The Run

Final assurance follows [verification](verification.md). Before goal completion require:

- every phase closed, with its checkpoint, one compacted summary, and source-coverage evidence;
- final assurance passed for the current deliverable;
- all implementation assignments complete, required subagents terminal, ownership released, and no pending evidence or blocker;
- limitations and residual risks ready for the user handoff.

Record `Complete goal and finalize ledger` in `Next Actions`, then check the complete ledger under Field Rules and reconcile it against the prerequisites above. Resolve
stale states, uncompacted phase logs, or structural errors before completing the goal; do not invent past transitions or evidence to make the ledger pass.
Keep that action pending while calling the goal completion tool under its contract. If completion fails, preserve the unfinished state and report the blocker; never
manufacture success. Goal `blocked` updates must obey the runtime's recurrence rules.

After goal completion succeeds, record its authoritative status and usage, final candidate, evidence, and risks. Set ledger status to `Ready For Final`, clear active
ownership, and set `Next Actions` to `None` to prepare the terminal snapshot. This state authorizes handoff only after the terminal checkpoint is verified or a valid
skipped disposition is confirmed; it does not prove persistence.

Check changed portions, then commit the remaining current-run ledger changes under the same commit protocol; skip only under its stated conditions. A completed
goal does not prove this step succeeded. On a failed or uncertain commit, record the pending persistence step in `Next Actions` and report the blocker. On resume, inspect
the checkpoint before retrying; do not repeat goal completion. Clear that pending action when preparing a retry snapshot.

After verifying the checkpoint or confirming a valid skipped disposition, deliver outcome, files, validation, risks, and ledger locator. Include the goal's
authoritative total token usage and human-friendly elapsed time when available, regardless of whether a token budget was configured; never estimate missing metrics.

If interrupted between goal completion and ledger finalization, reconcile the completed goal with terminal evidence and finish that ledger update. Check candidate
changes and ownership before reemitting a pending handoff; reuse valid evidence rather than rerunning accepted work. If the candidate changed, report the changes and
follow the tool's permitted goal lifecycle before further execution.
